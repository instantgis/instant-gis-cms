  Many organizations are turning to GIS. In the beginning there is GIS software
  selection and acquisition. That in itself is not as easy as it seems (we have
  a post to guide you with that). What GIS solution should we purchase?
  Commercial? Open Source? Do we need hardware? What should that be? After this
  decision is made then comes deployment. Great now you have a GIS system in
  place what's next? Next comes the steep learning curve where your staff learns
  how to use the GIS tools effectively. At this point the focus is on getting
  your data into GIS. That will take a while and only then can you start getting
  the benefits of GIS such as analysis and map publishing. But soon there will
  come a time where you will realize that having a map is not enough. Soon you
  will need to have applications built around those maps. Then comes the phase
  where you will also realize that a GIS system should not live in isolation in
  the organization. Inevitably there are things in your other subsystems such as
  CRM, WMS etc. that should be integrated with GIS and vice versa. The trouble
  is neither your GIS staff nor your IT has the time and knowhow to perform
  those integrations! That's when you should turn to an external integration
  services vendor like us to connect your GIS to your other subsystems and train
  your staff on how to do it.

This [week](/wdwdw) we’ll **take** a look at all the steps required to make astonishing coffee with a Chemex at home. The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual, pour-over style glass-container coffeemaker that Peter Schlumbohm invented in 1941, and which continues to be manufactured by the Chemex Corporation in Chicopee, Massachusetts\*.

In 1958, designers at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.spacefarm.digital) said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is *"one of the best-designed products of modern times"*, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

## The little secrets of Chemex brewing

The Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:

1. Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.
2. Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.
3. Never skip preheating the glass.
4. Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.

The most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.

For a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.
